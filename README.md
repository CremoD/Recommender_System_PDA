# Programming For Data Analytics Project 2019
## Kaggle competition: Recommender System
This repository contains the code for a Recommender System project developed and implemented to recommend the list of top 10 movies using user preferences and item content data. 

The developed scripts are written in Python, with the use of algorithms provided by the GraphLab libray, used and combined to build a recommender system that learns from a training set of users' ratings and predict and recommends a list of movies for a set of test users.

More details about the project and the solution adopted can be find in the [Report](Report.pdf).
