# Programming For Data Analytics Project 2019
## Kaggle competition: Recommender System
This repository contains the code for a project developed and implemented during the course "Programming for Data Analytics" of the Computational Data Science Master at the Free University of Bolzano.
The Project is based on the recommendation of top 10 movie list using user preferences and item content data. 

The developed scripts are written in Python, with the use of algorithms provided by the GraphLab libray, used and combined to build a recommender system that learns from a training set of users' ratings and predict and recommends a list of movies for a set of test users.

More details about the project and the solution adopted can be find in the [Report](Report.pdf).
